chocolatey

This is a chocolatey package provider.  This is currently based on uncommited changes to the upstream chocolatey project pending approval in a PR.  These can be grabbed from rismoney/chocolatey to test this.  Those files are chocolatey.ps1 and chocolatey-version.ps1.  They can be found here - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/119




Use it like this:

    class rich::packages {
      $pkglist = [‘notepadplusplus’, ‘msysgit’]

      package { $pkglist:
        ensure   => installed,
        provider => ‘chocolatey’,
      }
    }
